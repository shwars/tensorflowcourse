    "We understand what each letter **represents**, and how all characters come together to form the words of a sentence. However, computers by themselves do not have such an understanding, and neural network has to learn the meaning during training.\n",

    "Therefore, we can use different approaches when representing text:\n",
    "* **Character-level representation**, when we represent text by treating each character as a number. Given that we have $C$ different characters in our text corpus, the word *Hello* would be represented by $5\\times C$ tensor. Each letter would correspond to a tensor column in one-hot encoding.\n",
    "* **Word-level representation**, in which we create a **vocabulary** of all words in our text, and then represent words using one-hot encoding. This approach is somehow better, because each letter by itself does not have much meaning, and thus by using higher-level semantic concepts - words - we simplify the task for the neural network. However, given large dictionary size, we need to deal with high-dimensional sparse tensors.\n",

In fact, in most NLP tasks some words are more relevant than others.\n",
